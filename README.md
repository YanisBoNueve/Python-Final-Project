# Python-Final-Project

Rental bikes are being introduced in many urban cities to improve mobility and comfort. The goal of this movement is to modernize cities and promote a greener lifestyle. For example, Paris introduced "velibs" in 2007 and Amsterdam has more bikes than cars. The purpose of these initiatives is to make commuting easier and reduce car usage and pollution in Seoul. As a result, the development of alternative means of transportation has decreased the use of cars for commuting and sightseeing.

It is important to make rental bikes accessible to the public because they provide commuters in metropolises with multiple options. There are many benefits to bike rentals, including convenience (people don't have to keep the bike all day) and healthiness (it's a healthy way to travel). Additionally, bike rentals have numerous environmental benefits.

The dataset for this study contains weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point, solar radiation, snowfall, and rainfall. The target variable is the number of bikes rented per hour and date. The dataset covers data from December 1, 2017 to December 1, 2018.

The goal of Seoul Bike is to provide the city with a steady supply of rental bikes. It is crucial for the company to accurately predict the number of bike rentals per hour in order to maintain customer satisfaction. This study could potentially be shared with Seoul Bikes to help them determine if they need to restock bike stations in the city.

The project is implemented in Python and includes tasks for data visualization, machine learning modeling, and creating an API with Flask. So the repository includes the **presentation PDF**, a **Jupyter Notebook with the code**, and **the API**.

The study shows that bike rentals are influenced by various factors, including the day of the week, time of day, and weather conditions. It was found that most rentals occur during the week, suggesting that the bikes are mainly used for commuting to work or school. Additionally, the number of rentals increases during spring and summer, indicating that favorable weather conditions contribute to higher rental rates.

The best-performing machine learning model in the study was the extra trees regressor, and the results of the model are available through the API.
